# logistic_regression_project
#this model is developed by me[Arunachalam K] ,this performs good during the test,but it may misclassify anytime,so dont trust this predictions blindly.

This project is based on logistic regression to detect whether a person  have heart disease or not based on his health conditions ,they were listed below,
Attribute Information:

* age
* sex
* chest pain type (4 values)
* resting blood pressure
* serum cholestoral in mg/dl
* fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
* resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
* maximum heart rate achieved
* exercise induced angina
* oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
* thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
* target:0 for no presence of heart disease, 1 for presence of heart disease

based on the above detiails(labels/features) if the prediction is 0(the person dont have any heart disease) and 1(has heart disease)
